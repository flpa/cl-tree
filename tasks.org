      | -l            | Follows symbolic links if they point to directories, as if they were directories. Symbolic links that will result in recursion are avoided when detected.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              |
      | -f            | Prints the full path prefix for each file.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             |
      | -L level      | Max display depth of the directory tree.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               |
      | -P pattern    | List only those files that match the wild-card pattern.  Note: you must use the -a option to also consider those files beginning with a dot `.'  for matching.  Valid wildcard operators are `*' (any zero or more characters), `?' (any single character), `[...]' (any single character listed between brackets (optional - (dash) for character range may  be  used ex: [A-Z]), and `[^...]' (any single character not listed in brackets) and 'pipe' separates alternate patterns. |
      | -I pattern    | Do not list those files that match the wild-card pattern.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              |
