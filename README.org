# cl-tree
cl-tree is a Common Lisp toy re-implementation of the `tree` command commonly found on Unix-likes.
Its main purpose right is to serve as a playground for experimenting with 'system programming' topics in Common Lisp:
- filesystem access
- reading commandline arguments
- creating executables
